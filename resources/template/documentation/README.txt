CUSTOMISATION
--------------------------

1. Overriding Colour Skin
--------------------------
The theme offers 14 additional colour schemes (15 in total including the default green):
Green: #55A79A;
Red: #BE3E1D;
Purple: #b771b0;
Pink: #CC164D;
Orange: #e67e22;
Blue: #00ADBB;
Pink: #c71c77;
Lime: #b1dc44;
BlueDark: #34495e;
RedDark: #a10f2b;
Brown:  #91633c;
CyanDark:  #008b8b;
Yellow:  #D4AC0D;
Slate:  #5D6D7E;
Olive:  #808000;
Teal:  #008080;
GreenBright:  #2ECC71;


Each additional one has a separate .css file within the /css directory:
ie. colour-COLOURNAME.css

These files can be used as an example of how to implement your own colour schemes.

Example - Add the following to your <head> tags below the "<!--Your custom colour override-->": 
<link href="css/colour-blue.css" id="colour-scheme" rel="stylesheet">

NOTE: 
You will need to do this on all pages to implement site wide.
The "colour-scheme" ID tag is only required if you want the jQuery colour switcher to be functionality.
Quickest way to hide the colour switcher is to add .colour-switcher { display: none; } to your CSS.

If you are comfortable with using Sass it’s recommended to override the colour scheme by altering the $primary_colour variables and then recompiling the CSS, see the assets/scss/example-custom-colour.scss file for an example.

2. Overriding Other Styles
--------------------------
Using CSS: Similarly to colour overriding the theme also offers and automatically loads a skeleton file called "custom-style.css" which can be used to override the theme structure & media queries.
This file is found within the /css directory and is well commented to provide instruction.

Using Sass: 
a) If you are comfortable with using Sass you can also add any custom style overrides to the /assets/scss/custom/_custom-style.scss file and then recompiling the CSS. This file is automatically included. 
b) You can also pick and choose which core AppStrap Sass files you want to include by editing or cloning the /assets/scss/theme-style.scss file and only including the include files you want/need. theme-style.scss is commented to indicate which Sass include files are required and which are optional. 
c) You also have the option to override certain AppStrap styles using the /assets/scss/custom/_custom-variables.scss file which allows you to override the variables set in the /assets/scss/core/_variables.scss. This file is automatically included.

NOTE: You should ideally not edit any sass files in the /core directory to make future updates easier.

See #11 below for more information on using Sass.


3. Adding New Pages
--------------------------
All pages within the theme are designed to be copy & pasted to help you quickly get started with page building.


4. Retina Images
----------------------------------------------------
AppStrap is retina (High Definition) ready (as of version 2.0) and all images provided with the theme are also offered with a retina version.
To make your own images retina ready you just need to think double sized & appended @2x to the filename.

Here's an example:
* Standard definition size:     310px wide X 410px high
* High definition size:         620px wide X 820px high
* Standard definition filename: my-image.jpg
* High definition filename:     my-image@2x.jpg

Place both images in the same directory and the Retina.js plugin (http://retinajs.com/) will automatically swap in the high definition version on device which support retina display.
NOTE: This is totally optional, if the plugin does not find a retina version of any images, the standard definition image is left.


5. Mobile Menu Options
----------------------------------------------------
AppStrap (since version 2.0) supports both Bootstraps default mobile menu and the jPanel Menu jQuery plugin (http://jpanelmenu.com/) combined with jRespond plugin.

jPanel Menu is implemented as default, to switch to the default Bootstrap mobile menu you just need to replace the line:
<a class="navbar-btn" data-toggle="jpanel-menu" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
with:
<a class="navbar-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">

See the bs-mobile-menu.htm file for an example.


6. Sticky Navbar
----------------------------------------------------
Sticky header/navbar functionality is enabled by default via the FixTo plugin (https://github.com/bbarakaci/fixto). 

To remove this functionality simply remove the data-toggle=“clingify” or data-toggle=“sticky” attribute from your header element.


7. Flexslider Slideshow Animations
----------------------------------------------------
AppStrap (since version 2.0) supports intro animations on slideshows thanks to the amazing animate.css plugin.
The animation is CSS based so not supported by older browsers.

Animations:
All the animations provided by animate.css can be added to elements within the slideshow slides using the data-animate-in attribute to animate them, some examples:
data-animate-in="bounceInLeft"
data-animate-in="fadeInUp"

Animation durations:
You can control the duration of animations using the data-animate-duration attribute, options are:
data-animate-duration="dur-fast"   = 0.5 seconds
data-animate-duration="dur-slow"   = 2 seconds
data-animate-duration="dur-x-slow" = 3 seconds

Animation delays:
You can delay animations using the data-animate-delay attribute, options are:
data-animate-delay="de-02" = 0.2 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-04" = 0.4 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-06" = 0.6 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-08" = 0.8 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-1"  = 1 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-12" = 1.2 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-14" = 1.4 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-16" = 1.6 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-18" = 1.8 seconds
data-animate-delay="de-2"  = 2 seconds

Full example:
<h2 data-animate-in="bounceInRight" data-animate-delay="de-06" data-animate-duration="dur-x-slow">AppStrap Bootstrap Theme</h2>


8. Slider Revolution Slider
----------------------------------------------------
Slider Revolution Slider allows for advanced slideshows & animation. 
You can invoke it using data-toggle=“slider-rev” on the slider element.

Styling
--------------------------
AppStrap applies its own styling to Slider Revolution elements via the .slider-appstrap-theme class which is add via the following line on Slider Revolution pages:
<div class="slider-wrapper tp-banner-container" data-page-class="slider-appstrap-theme">

To remove AppStrap styling and use default Slider Revolution styles simply remove the data-page-class="slider-appstrap-theme" attribute.

Options
--------------------------
All Slider Revolution options can be passed to the slider via HTML5 data- attributes placed on the slider element (data-toggle=“slider-rev”).
ie. data-SETTINGNAME
data-startwidth=“420” translate to the Slider Revolution setting startwidth.


See the /theme/plugins/slider-revolution/ directory for examples & documentation or visit http://themes.themepunch.com/?theme=revolution_jq


9. Hover Dropdown menus
----------------------------------------------------
Since AppStrap 2.4 drop down menus show on hover. 
When adding new drop down menus simply add data-toggle="dropdown" data-hover="dropdown" to the trigger link make them show on hover instead of click.
For submenus you should include data-close-others="false" so the parent menu is not closed when hovering a submenu.

To revert to using “click” drop down simple remove the usage of  data-hover="dropdown" on drop down trigger links.

See https://github.com/CWSpear/bootstrap-hover-dropdown for more info.


10. Pages in subfolders
----------------------------------------------------
If you want to put your pages into subfolders you will need to alter the path to the plugins so the script.js file can find them correctly.
To do this (since AppStrap version 3.0.5) you can simply add the following to the body tag for all pages that are within subfolders:
<body data-plugins-localpath=“LOCAL-PATH”> 

If you pages is within 1 subfolder it would look something like:
<body data-plugins-localpath=“../assets/plugins/”>


11. Using Sass
----------------------------------------------------
Since AppStrap version 3.0.5 Sass files for compile the CSS code have been included to allow quick customisation of the core AppStrap CSS files.

If you’re new to Sass we recommend taking a course over at uDemy like: 
http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=sgB7hwli/bc&subid=&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https://www.udemy.com/sasscourse/

a) Compiling using Gulp:
-------------------------- 
Gulp is a task runner which we recommend you use gulp to compile the sass files into css. Included in AppStrap’s /theme directory are 2 files which gulp uses: 
1. package.json - this defines the gulp dependencies AppStrap needs to compile the sass files
2. gulpfile.js - this defines the gulp tasks which should run to compile the sass files into css code, there are also some “clean up” tasks run on Javascript & images.

Installing Gulp:
Step 1) Gulp needs node.js & node package manager (npm) to run so those need to be installed first, instructions are here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
Step 2) Open up terminal or command line and type the following command to install gulp globally on your machine: 
npm install --global gulp-cli

Type “gulp -v” to ensure gulp installed correctly, if it did you’ll see something like:
[13:42:05] CLI version 3.9.1
[13:42:05] Local version 3.9.1

Step 3) Type the following command to install all the gulp dependencies defined by the package.json file: 
npm install --save-dev gulp

If everything work correctly you should see a new directory called “node_modules” which is full of the dependencies. Once you’ve finished your development you can remove this directory and just run the above command again to get the latest dependencies each time.

Step 4) Type the following command to have gulp watch for file changes to the .scss & .js files:
gulp watch

Alternative you can just type “gulp” to compile .scss & .js files and compress all images in the theme on a one off basis. You can use “Ctrl” + “c” to exit gulp at anytime.

You can look for any errors in terminal after running the above commands.

To find out more about gulp see: http://gulpjs.com/ 


b) Compiling using an app/GUI
--------------------------
If you don’t want to mess around with gulp or node.js there are a number of apps out there which can compile sass code into css.
We recommend the following apps: 
- http://koala-app.com/
- https://codekitapp.com/index.html
- http://livereload.com/
- https://mhs.github.io/scout-app/


c) Example sass files
--------------------------
There are a number of example .scss files prefixed with “example-*.scss” to show you how you can change things within the theme or strip back to only the styles you want.
We have broken up the sass files into logical includes to make it easier for you to pick and choose which styles to include.
If you would like a specific example please email us at info@themelize.me and we’ll do our best to include it in a future update.
