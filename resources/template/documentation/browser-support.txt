------------------------------

APPSTRAP INTERNET EXPLORER SUPPORT
------------------------------
AppStrap supports IE9+ although some plugins do not work with IE9 but the general theme layout and components do.

To support IE9 you need to include the asset/css/no-flexbox.css file & assets/css/theme-style.ie.min.css files in your pages after all your other CSS files:
<!-- Optional: Remove flexbox support either by choice or for IE9 -->  
<link href="assets/css/ie.theme-style.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  
<link href="assets/css/no-flexbox.css" rel="stylesheet">


Plugins that donâ€™t support IE9:
- Dropdowns on hover
