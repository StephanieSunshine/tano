- Replace: assets/js/scripts.js & assets/js/scripts.min.js
- Replace: assets/css/theme-style.css & assets/css/theme-style.min.css
- Bootstrap 4.0.0 Alpha 6: the -xs infix has been removed from col-*, float-*, text align & display classes so for example float-xs-right is now simply float-right, text-xs-center would be just text-center & col-xs-6 is just col-6. sm, md, lg, and xl still remain.
- Bootstrap 4.0.0 Alpha 6: .navbar-toggleable classes are now applied to the .navbar element instead of navbar .collapse element
